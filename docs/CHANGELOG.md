# Changelog

## 1.3.0

- **Save time machine (Tools → Saves):** turn it on and Ally Hub snapshots a game's saves every time it starts,
  keeping the last few per game. Restore any of them from Game Mode. Your saves as they are now are kept first, and
  **Undo the last restore** puts them back. Uses Ludusavi (one tap to install).
- **Sleep guardian (Tools → Sleep):** every sleep is tracked: how long, how much battery it used, what woke the
  handheld, and sleeps that failed. If sleep drains too much or a USB device keeps waking it, the page says so and
  can stop that device from waking it (the power button always works). **Send the sleep details** reports it.

## 1.2.2

- **Quick Access panel:** Ally Hub in the ••• menu while you play. Battery and temperatures, switches for the game
  you're playing, Game Boost, lighting and a save backup button. Add it under Tools → Games (needs Decky Loader).
- **Game settings (Tools → Games):** switches instead of typing launch options: FSR 4, frame generation, Steam Deck
  mode, an older-game fix and a troubleshooting log. Pick the Proton per game, and get help when a game won't start
  (try another Proton, reset its Windows files with a backup, send the log, check its files).
- **Storage saver (Tools → Storage):** each game's real size including its shader cache and Windows files, and a
  one-tap cleanup of what Steam leaves behind. Anything that can hold saves starts unticked.
- **Never stuck with a bad plugin:** every Decky plugin can be turned off and back on without uninstalling it, from
  its card or the new **Your plugins** list on the Plugin store page. **Turn all plugins off** finds a troublemaker
  fast, and **Turn them back on** restores exactly those.
- **Launchers:** **Hide from Steam** keeps a launcher installed but takes its tile out of your library. Adding it
  back just restores the tile.
- **EmuDeck** now has a Remove button (EmuDeck's own uninstaller, or just its app if it was never set up).
- **Interface and text size are remembered separately for Game Mode and Desktop Mode**, so switching no longer
  means changing the size every time.

## 1.1.1

- **Update channel:** Settings → Updates can now follow **Testing** builds to get new features before everyone
  else. Everyone stays on **Stable** unless they switch, and switching back offers the stable version right away.

## 1.1.0

- **Library art:** blank blue tiles for launchers and Ally Hub itself now get a cover, banner, hero and icon,
  made on your handheld from each program's own icon. No SteamGridDB, nothing downloaded. New launchers get theirs
  automatically, and Install → Launchers has **Fix artwork** and **Use my own picture**.
- Pictures you set yourself are never replaced.
